## About me

Hello. Taber here gonna give you a little bit of a intoduction to who I am and what I'm about. First and foremost I am passionate about art in all it's forms.
This passion has guided me from a young age to eventually earn a Bachelor of Fine art. I've also always been passionate about tech, and functionality; wanting 
to build robots. I started to learned AutoCad and spent time practicing woodworking, masonry, and and other hands on construction related skills. 

After years of labor and never finding my niche in construction world, I have moved into the more mentally stimulating and fascinating world of coding. Starting with
full-stack web development, I've learned several useful languages and practices for creating applications. The amount of knowledge and possibilities that coding has
are limitless and have an ever alluring draw to them. The pull for more knowledge and improving my skills and capabilities is a never ending desire. 


# Goals

I have several milestones I'd like to achieve throughout my coding career. In no particular order :
- game development
- machine learning / AI
- application development
- learn new languages daily, monthly, and yearly : continuing to improve my understanding and ablities as a developer
- enjoy what I do
